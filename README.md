# grunt-cep
> A Grunt plugin that helps debugging and packaging HTML5-based extensions for Adobe Creative Cloud applications.

By using this task you can debug and package HTML5-based extensions for Adobe&reg; Creative Cloud&reg; products directly from Grunt, in a totally automated manner and without the Adobe Extension Builder plugin.

The tool can automatically generate self-signed certificates for extension packaging and automates some error-prone tasks such as bundle and extension manifest files creation. It supports hybrid extensions and lets you create different builds of an extension bundle based on targeted Adobe products.

It is based on the `csxs` command line tool by [Creative Market](https://github.com/creativemarket/csxs).

**Please note:** the plugin is currently in alpha stage and may contain bugs. Options are not freezed and may change in future versions.

## Changelog

Note: This version depends on zxp-provider 1.1.3 explicitly to work around issues introduced in 1.1.4 on osx.

Updated in this fork: Added support for copying node modules automatically, using node_modules array in gruntfile.
Ex.
```
release: {
	options: {
		profile: 'package',
		node_modules: ["json5", "hjson"]
	},
}
```

## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`. Please refer to the [official documentation](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) to get started with Grunt. You may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-cep --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile as usual:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-cep');
```

### Project Boilerplate
You can use the [_grunt-init-cep_](https://github.com/fcamarlinghi/grunt-init-cep) template to easily get started. The template tool will install all the required files automatically and provide you with a basic extension boilerplate, already configured to run inside the chosen target applications.

Please refer to the [_grunt-init-cep_](https://github.com/fcamarlinghi/grunt-init-cep) documentation for installation and usage instruction.

### Advanced Setup
Bundle icon, manifest, MXI and `update.xml` files provided by the template can also be found in the `res/bundle` folder located inside the plugin installation folder. If you prefer, you can manually copy these files instead of using the _grunt-init-cep_ template.

_grunt-cep_ is setup to use these files by default, so just copy the `res/bundle` folder to the root of your project (that is, the same folder of your `Gruntfile.js`) and you should be good to go.

#### Custom Manifest, XML and MXI Files
XML and MXI template files are populated at build time using configuration properties. For most extensions the provided templates should work just fine, but for complex extensions it might be necessary to make changes to these files or even provide custom ones.

Note that _grunt-cep_ makes no assumptions about and does no validation on extension files content, so be sure to provide valid files and to modify extension configuration accordingly.

## The _cep_ Task
You may run the task with this command:

```shell
grunt cep
```

### Options
_grunt-cep_ has several options that you can customize to fit your needs. To avoid cluttering your `Gruntfile.js` it is more advisable to keep the options in an external Javascript or JSON file for easier editing and import them at run-time using either:

```js
require('cep-config.js');
```

or:

```js
grunt.file.readJSON('cep-config.json');
```

Options defined in the external file can be overwritten in child tasks as needed (see the example below). Default values and a more in-depth description for all the properties below can be found in the <code>/options/defaults.js</code> file in the plugin installation folder.

#### options
These properties define base task options.

#### options.builds
The ability to specify single builds is one of the most powerful feature of _grunt-cep_ when dealing with complex extension bundles.

The `cep.builds` property is an array of objects describing the various builds that should be executed, each one resulting in a separate _ZXP_ file that will be bundled with the final _ZXP_ installer.

Each build object contains the following properties and extends the main task configuration, giving you the ability to override base configuration values on a per-build basis.

<table width="100%">

		<td valign="top"><strong>products</strong></td>
		<td valign="top">Array</td>
		<td valign="top">An array of strings containing the name of the products targeted by this build. Valid product names include: <code>photoshop</code>, <code>illustrator</code>, <code>indesign</code>, <code>flash</code>, <code>dreamweaver</code>, <code>premiere</code>, <code>prelude</code>.</td>

	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><strong>families</strong></td>
		<td valign="top">Array</td>

## Usage Examples
The example configuration below is based on the [_grunt-init-cep_](https://github.com/fcamarlinghi/grunt-init-cep) project template and defines an extension for Adobe Photoshop CC. It registers two tasks (`debug` and `release`) which respectively launch debug inside Adobe Photoshop CC and package the full extension.

All the icons and file templates referenced in the configuration are available in the project template (see the Getting Started section).

```javascript
// cep-config.js
module.exports =
{
    bundle: {
        version: '0.1.0',
        id: 'com.foo.exampleBundle',
        name: 'Example Bundle',
        author_name: 'Foo',
        mxi_icon: 'bundle/icon-mxi.png',
    },
    
    extensions: [{
        version: '0.1.0',
        id: 'com.foo.exampleBundle.examplePanel',
        name: 'Example Panel',
        author_name: 'Foo',
        icons: {
            panel: {
                light: {
                    normal: 'icons/icon-light.png',
                    hover: 'icons/icon-light-hover.png',
                    disabled: 'icons/icon-light-disabled.png'
                },
                dark: {
                    normal: 'icons/icon-dark.png',
                    hover: 'icons/icon-dark-hover.png',
                    disabled: 'icons/icon-dark-disabled.png'
                },
            }
        },
        size: {
            normal: { width: 320, height: 440 },
            min: { width: 320, height: 440 },
            max: { width: 600, height: 600 },
        },
        main_path: 'example.html',
        script_path: 'extendscript/example.jsx',
    }],

    builds: [
        // Adobe Photoshop CC
        {
            bundle: { manifest: 'bundle/manifest.bundle.cc.xml' },
            extensions: [{ manifest: 'bundle/manifest.extension.xml' }],
            products: ['photoshop'],
            source: 'src',
        },
    ],

    'package': {
        certificate: {
            password: 'example_password',
        }
    },
};
```

```javascript
// Grunfile.js
grunt.initConfig({

    // ...

    cep: {
        options: require('./cep-config.js'),

        debug: {
            options: { 
                profile: 'launch',
                launch: {
                    product: 'photoshop',
                },
            }
        },

        release: {
            options: { profile: 'package' }
        },
    },

    // ...
    
});
```
By running: 
```shell
grunt cep:debug
```
_grunt-cep_ will compile all the files in the `src` folders along with other extension files, install the resulting extension and launch Photoshop for testing.

If you want to package the Example extension just run:
```shell
grunt cep:release
```
and a compiled _.ZXP_ file will be created in the `staging` folder.

### Automatic Deploying
Something that I find particularly useful is the ability to automatically deploy the compiled extension to a website. This can be easily achieved using the `grunt-ftp-deploy` plugin:

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
	// grunt-cep
	cep: {
		// Your config here...
	},

	// FTP deploy
	"ftp-deploy": {
		release: {
			auth: {
				host: 'foo.it',
				port: 21,
				authKey: 'foo'
			},
			src: 'staging',
			dest: '/release',
			exclusions: ['debug', 'package', 'release'] // Exclude work directories
		},
	},
});

// Load plugins
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-cep');
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-ftp-deploy');

// Integrated packaging and deploying
grunt.registerTask('deploy', ['cep:release', 'ftp-deploy:release']);
```

When the `deploy` task is run, the `cep:release` task will package your extension and `ftp-deploy` will upload the relevant files (ZXP installer and "update.xml") to the `foo.it` website.
